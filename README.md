<p align="center">I believe that the more you teach, the more you learn; so watch out for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpLKBAAh_Du5nLE7ZW6AjQg">YouTube channel</a> where you can learn how to code</p>

<p align="center">After being in the web development area of software development for a while, I recently dived into mobile development majoring in iOS development and writing the Swift language. I am also looking into cross platform development using Flutter. I look forward to looking into backend development too. As a software engineer, the more I learn, the more I realize how much I still need to learn. When I am not writing code or fixing bugs, I am seeing animated movies or spending time with loved ones. I enjoy growth and look forward to growing everyday.</p>
