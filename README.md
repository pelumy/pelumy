<p align="center">After being in the web development area of software development for a while, I recently dived into mobile development majoring in iOS development and writing the Swift language. I plan to understand backend development too. As a software engineer, the more I learn, the more I realize how much I still need to learn. When I am not writing code or fixing bugs, I am seeing animated movies or spending time with loved ones. I enjoy growth and look forward to growing everyday.</p>
